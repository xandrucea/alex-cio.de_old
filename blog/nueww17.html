                    This was the first time I visited the IndieWebCamp in Nuremberg. I heard a lot of things about the Web Week in the last years, but I never had time to visit one of the interesting events taking place in my city!

                  <h3>What is the Indie Web Camp</h3>

                  <p>
                    People from all over the world, but mostly out of the region, come together. Many of them own a website, some of them are interested to get one, and others maybe just want to understnd what it means to be indie! 
                    To break it down shortly, it is about how you share data about youself and own the information. Further more it is about the way to engage with each other betweeen the owners website and also seeing social media engagements. But all in one place and on your website first!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Camp takes two days. The first day consists of many different topics, covering topics like IndieOAuth, Microformats and Webmentions but also other topics that might be of interest to some of the participants. For me it was a discussion about a new social media platform and how you can use newsletters for reaching out to your audience. <br>
                    The second day is more practical. For me this all was totally new and I am also no web developer, but I already had a basic website. I already added the web sign in some weeks ago, so I passed the first test on <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">indiewebify.me</a>. You just have to add the html tag <strong>rel="me"</strong> to your social media links. After this you can sign in on websites that support IndieAuth, and if your social media accounts are linking back to your website.

                    I started to add some Microformats to my website. First I added a h-card, my personal v-card. I also added other Microformats like linking to websites of friends as well as book reviews of read books, that also include ratings.

                    This is me working on my own website on the second day of the IndieWebCamp and trying to setup different types of Microformats as well as preparing my page to include a posting section where I can implement webmentions in the future too!
